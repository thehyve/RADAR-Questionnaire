                <div class="detail text-align">We know your time is valuable. That’s why the HOME app has two types of surveys — one short and one longer. Each time we want you to complete one of these surveys you will be sent a notification to open the HOME app.</div>
                <div class="detail text-align">In the short survey, sent either once a week or every three days, you will be asked about your health in the last week. If you have been feeling well, this will take less than 15 seconds to complete. If you have not been well, it will take about 1 min to complete.</div>
                <div class="detail text-align">In the longer surveys, sent once a week, you will be asked about a wider range of health and non-health related questions. These surveys are designed to take less than 5 minutes to complete.</div>
