A hybrid mobile application to actively capture data for the RADAR-Base Platform.

## Note

We use the [Ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/docs/), which is built with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and wraps [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/).

## Install

First install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

Globally install ionic and cordova:

```
$ yarn global add ionic cordova
```

In the project folder run `yarn` to install dependencies:

```
$ yarn
```
Create a directory named `www` under the root folder
```
$ mkdir www
```

Cordova provides a simple command to install the plugins and platforms set in `package.json` or `config.xml`.

```
$ cordova prepare
```

To run the application in the browser use:

```
$ ionic serve
```

## Guidelines

Use the following command to sort, format and fix common css problems:

```
$ yarn fix:css
```

Use the following command before commiting to fix all common styling and sorting problems:

```
$ yarn fix:all
```

## Platforms

In order to add platforms to target, you must install the required SDKs.

### Android

To add the Android platform, you need to have the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) pre installed. This step also adds the plugins listed in `config.xml` to the project.

```
$ ionic cordova platform add android
```

Run the app in an Android device:

```
$ ionic cordova run android
```

Run the app in an Android emulator:

```
$ ionic cordova emulate android
```

### iOS

To add the iOS platform, you need to have [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) pre installed.

```
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
```

Run the app in an iOS device:

```
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

## Firebase

If using Firebase for notifications, analytics, or remote config, [create your Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Then, add your iOS or Android app to the Firebase project. Once added, please download the app's `google-services.json` file (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS), and add it to the root directory.

### Remote Notifications

If using FCM pull notifications instead of the local ones, please specify the FCM sender id (as mentioned in FCM settings) in `src/assets/data/defaultConfig.ts` and the default notification type to FCM (this is already the default value).

```ts
export const FCMPluginProjectSenderId = 'your-sender-id'
export const DefaultNotificationType = 'FCM'
```

In order for notifications to be sent, you must run your own app server. It is part of the [RADAR-base stack](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-Docker/), and specific docs can be found [here](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-Docker/tree/dev/dcompose-stack/firebase-app-server).

#### iOS Remote Push Notifications

For Android remote notifications, setting your sender ID and adding your `google-services.json` file is enough to begin receiving notifications. However, for iOS notifications, you must add either an APNs authentication key or APNs certificate to connect with Apple Push Notifications. This can be added in the Firebase project's Cloud Messaging settings.

### Remote Config

Certain values can be overriden using Firebase Remote Config. Specifically, the following variables are supported:

| Parameter                 | Description                                                                                                                   | Default value                                                                                                    |

#### Conditions

Conditions can be added to remote config variables to target specific groups of users. Different condition rule types are supported: app, platform, country/region, user property, date/time, and random percentile. For example a `protocol_branch` config value can be different based on the user property `projectId`.

### Analytics

In order to personalize Firebase events and remote config variables, certain user properties may be added to the Firebase console. Specifically, the following user properties are supported:

| Property          | Description                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `subjectId`       | Custom identifier for the user                                    |
| `humanReadableId` | Human readable identifier for the user                            |
| `baseUrl`         | Custom identifier for the base URL of the project                 |
| `projectId`       | Custom identifier for the project that a user belongs to          |
| `sourceId`        | Custom identifier for the source the application is registered as |
| `enrolmentDate`   | Enrolment date of the user                                        |

Further details on the events that are already logged, default events, and default user properties can be found on the [RADAR Base wiki pages](https://radar-base.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RAD/pages/905707521/Firebase+Analytics).

## Other Config Options

Copy `src/assets/data/secret.ts.template` to `src/assets/data/secret.ts` and add the following configuration -

```ts
// The client secret for OAuth authorisation with the Management Portal
export const DefaultSourceProducerAndSecretExport = 'aRMT:<aRMT-secret>'
```

In `src/assets/data/defaultConfig.ts` the following settings can be changed:

The Default endpoint of where the RADAR-base platform is hosted.

```ts
export const DefaultEndPoint = 'https://your-hosted-radar-platform-base-url/'
```

Also change the Default Github source details where the questionnaire scheduling protocols and questionnaire schemas are hosted.

```ts
// The Github repository where the protocols are located
export const DefaultProtocolGithubRepo = 'RADAR-Base/RADAR-aRMT-protocols'

// The name of the branch in the protocol repository
export const DefaultProtocolBranch = 'master'

// The name of the repository where the questionnaire schemas are located
export const DefaultSchemaGithubRepo = 'RADAR-Base/RADAR-Schemas'

// The name of the branch in the schema repository
export const DefaultSchemaBranch = 'master'
```

## Adding Language Support

Translations must be specified or modified in the localisations file `(src/assets/data/localisations.ts)`. When adding additional text in the localisations file, additional keys must also be added to `src/app/shared/enums/localisations.ts`.

To add additional languages, the following default config `(src/assets/data/defaultConfig.ts)` variable must be updated:

```ts
export const DefaultSettingsSupportedLanguages: LanguageSetting[] = []
```

## Publishing to the Google Playstore

Instructions to build a signed apk for publishing on the playstore -

1. Clone the aRMT project from github.
2. Configure it as per instructions above.
3. Run the following to build the app

```shell
yarn install
yarn build
ionic cordova platform add android
yarn install
ionic cordova build --release android
```

4. This will generate an apk at `<your-project-path>/platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk`
5. Create a keystore for signing the apk. Keep this safe as this is tied to your play releases and only apks signed by this can be released to the playstore after the intitial release.
6. You will need to then sign this apk using jarsigner

```
jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -storepass <your-keystore-pass> -keystore <your-keystore-path> <your-project-path>/platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk alias_name;
```

7. Then you will need to align the apk using zipalign (https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/zipalign) like-

```
$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/27.0.2/zipalign -v 4 <your-project-path>/platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk <your-project-path>/platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/radar-armt-app-$APP_VERSION.apk;
```

8. Now the apk is ready to be uploaded to the playstore at path `<your-project-path>/platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/radar-armt-app-$APP_VERSION.apk`
9. NOTE: The signing and aligning can also be done by importing the android project at path `<your-project-path>/platforms/android/` into Android Studio.
